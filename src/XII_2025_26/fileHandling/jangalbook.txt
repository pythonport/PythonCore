Once upon a time, deep in the Indian jungle,
a small boy was found in a basket by a family of wolves. 
The boy, named Mowgli, was raised by the wolves as one of their own. 
The leader of the wolf pack, Akela, 
liked Mowgli very much and decided to protect him from the dangers of the jungle.

Mowgli grew up learning the ways of the jungle from his wolf 
family and his friends, Baloo the bear and Bagheera the black
 panther. Baloo taught Mowgli the rules of the jungle and 
 how to find food, while Bagheera taught him how to move 
 quietly and stay safe. The jungle was a place of 
 adventure and wonder for Mowgli, and he loved it very much.
