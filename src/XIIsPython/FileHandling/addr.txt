readline() will return a line read,
 as a string from the file. First 
 call to function will return first line, second
call next line and so on. Remember 
file object keeps the track of from 
where reading / writing of data
should happen. For readline() 
a line is terminated by \n (i.e. new line character).
 The new line character is
also read from the file and post-fixed in the string. 
When end of file is reached, readline() will return an
empty string.
